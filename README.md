Chrome Extension for Phishing Website Detection
Overview
This project is a Chrome extension designed to detect phishing websites. It utilizes a backend built with Node.js and a machine learning model implemented in Python to analyze and identify potential phishing threats.

Features
Phishing Detection: The extension uses a machine learning algorithm (MLP - Multilayer Perceptron) to detect phishing websites.
Backend Integration: Node.js is used for the backend, handling requests and managing communication between the extension and the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model: The detection algorithm is implemented in Python, integrated with Node.js for real-time detection.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Chrome Extension
Backend: Node.js
Machine Learning: Python, MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) algorithm
Usage
Start the Backend Server:
Ensure the Node.js server is running .

Use the Extension:
Open Chrome and use the extension as usual.
When you navigate to a website, the extension will check for phishing indicators using the machine learning model.
